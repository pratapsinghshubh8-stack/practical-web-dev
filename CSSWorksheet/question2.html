    <!-- The first paragraph will use the ID (#special) styles -->
    <p id='special' class='highlight'>CSS Priority Test - ID should win</p>

    <!-- The second paragraph only has the class (.highlight) applied -->
    <p class='highlight'>This is a regular highlight test</p>

    <!-- The third paragraph has no styles applied -->
    <p>This paragraph has no styles</p>

    <h3>Observations:</h3>
    <p>The first paragraph, "CSS Priority Test - ID should win," appears in red, bold, and underlined text. This demonstrates that the ID selector (#special) has a higher priority (specificity) than the class selector (.highlight) in CSS. When both conflict over properties like color and font-weight, the ID's rules are applied.</p>
