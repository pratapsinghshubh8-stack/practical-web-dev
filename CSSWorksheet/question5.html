  <p>This paragraph will wrap around the image. The float property pulls the image to the left, allowing block-level elements like this paragraph to flow around it. This is a classic layout technique for magazine and news-style content to interleave images with descriptive text effectively.</p>

  <p class="clear-paragraph">This is a new paragraph that uses the clear: both; property. It will not appear next to the floated image above it but will instead start on a new line below the entire image, regardless of which side it was floated on. This is useful for separating distinct sections of content.</p>
